; Expanding the Hiker's cast is hard, as Rock-types are actually quite limited.
; Machop is more of an exception and not the rule, it's just "strong".

; Poison Pokemon. Poison Pokemon everywhere.
; Much of this seems to represent the pollution caused by petrol gas.
; So while Poison should be here, edits should be made with that in mind.
; This makes editing the Biker deceptively difficult.
; GSC adds Smokescreen Fire-types like Flareon, Magmar, and Charmeleon.
; I think we should do that, as well as add Horsea and Seadra into the mix.
; This makes for a much better Biker.
