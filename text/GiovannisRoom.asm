; Much of the text here is taken from real Giovanni lore. You could say I wanted to write a love letter to Giovanni as a character here.
; If you read all this, thank you for loving this character as much as I do.

; Mysteries of the Earth is a book written by Giovanni in the Adventures Manga. In that book, he is confirmed to have discovered Rhyperior.
; Additionally, in Adventures, his first caught Pokemon was a Weedle - this is why he uses Beedrill.

; We never have Giovanni use Charizard, as he's never shown doing so, even in Origins.
; My assumption is one of the following;
; - He doesn't want it involved with his Yakuza activities.
; - He released it.
; - His mother ended up selling it.
; I like giving the player the opportunity to think about this too!
